    "I had to make a few changes to `glue-jupyter` to make things work in JupyterLite, so we install from our own wheel. In particular, the changes made from regular `glue-jupyter` are:\n",
    "* I built a wheel for `tornado`, but it didn't seem to load properly in here. So I changed `glue-jupyter` to use the `asyncio` event loop instead (which `tornado.IOLoop` is just a wrapper around anyways).\n",
    "* The glue-jupyter toolbar uses `traitlets.Any` for `active_tool_id`, which JupyterLite doesn't seem to like. But the tool ID is always just a string or `None`, so we just use `traitlets.Unicode` with `allow_none=True` instead.\n",
    "* It also seems that JupyterLite doesn't like the `vue_` methods that `ipyvuetify` can expose to Vue from Python - I'm not sure why yet, but I suspect that it's related to how that uses the Jupyter comms. For the histogram viewer widget, I used a hacky tweak where we instead modify a traitlet flag and then call the code that we would've wanted in the observer."
